RobustART is a comprehensive Robustness investigation benchmark on ImageNet regarding ARchitectural design (49 human-designed off-the-shelf architectures and neural architecture searched networks) and Training techniques (10+ general ones e.g., extra training data, etc) towards diverse noises (adversarial, natural, and system noises). 

The benchmark (including open-source toolkit, pre-trained model zoo, datasets, and analyses):
- presents an open-source platform for conducting comprehensive evaluation on diverse robustness types;
- provides a variety of pre-trained models with different training techniques to facilitate robustness evaluation;
- proposes a new view to better understand the mechanism towards designing robust DNN architectures, backed up by the analysis.

For more details, please refer to the [website](http://robust.art/). We will continuously contribute to building this ecosystem for the community.
